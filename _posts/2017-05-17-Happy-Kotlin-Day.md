Although Kotlin has been around for a number of years, the last 2 years really kicked off getting Kotlin to 1.0 and beyond.

With impetus from Swift on IOS, it enabled Kotlin to be promoted as a slick and concise replacement for Java on Android.

Bundled inside Android Studio starting with the new 3.0 build.

Google are supporting and partnering a Kotlin non-profit foundation.
