Although Kotlin has been around for a number of years, the last 2 years really kicked off a surge getting Kotlin to 1.0 and beyond.

With impetus from Swift on IOS, it enabled Kotlin to be promoted as a slick and concise replacement for Java on Android.

Announcement: [https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/05/kotlin-on-android-now-official/](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/05/kotlin-on-android-now-official/)

So then, announced at Google I/O, Kotlin is now an official 1st class language on Android and offers developers a parity with Swift on IOS.

Bundled inside Android Studio starting with the new 3.0 build. See [https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/index.html](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/index.html)

Google are supporting and partnering a Kotlin non-profit foundation.
 

Finally, at Google I/O, we see a short demo where a single data class can replace over 80 lines of Java. Then, copy Java code and paste into your Kotlin project to perform inline conversion.
