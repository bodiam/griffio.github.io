Although [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) has been around for a number of years, the last 2 years really kicked off a surge getting Kotlin to 1.0 and beyond.

With impetus from Swift on IOS, it enabled Kotlin to be promoted as a slick and concise replacement for Java on Android.

Google are supporting and partnering a Kotlin non-profit foundation.
 

Finally, at [Google I/O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZBWVwoJaJs):57mins, we see a short demo where a single data class can replace over 80 lines of Java. Then, to gain familiarity, copy Java code and paste into your Kotlin project to perform inline conversion.
