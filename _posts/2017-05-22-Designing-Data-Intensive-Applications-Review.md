This is a reference to the first printed edition from March 2017.

Presented at over 500 pages, in three parts, to cover "The big ideas behind reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems".

The "big ideas" here are taken from the last 30 years consolidated in Document based, Graph, Relational and Key Value storage systems.

The recurring idea is that for any given problem there are several solutions, for example, in memory or disk based storage.

We can expect hybrid solutions that take on the characteristics of more than one model.

The data access pattens presented are relevant for readers who are front-end developers streaming data into the UI and may have already have encountered uni-directional dataflow models like ReactJS.

This book is about the building blocks of data systems and the engineering it requires to provide the three pillars of *Reliability*, *Scalability*, and *Maintainability*.

**Journey through** a sometimes pessimistic geography :-

Ocean of Distributed data

Sea of Derived Data

Gulf of Binary Encodings

Bay of Causality

Partitioning Atoll

Wrecks of Homegrown consensus Alogorithms

Harsh Winds of Reality
