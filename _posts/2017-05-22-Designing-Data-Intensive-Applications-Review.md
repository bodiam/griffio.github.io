This is a reference to the first printed edition from March 2017.

Presented at over 500 pages, in three parts, to cover "The big ideas behind reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems".

For readers who are front-end developers looking into the streaming data patterns emerging into the UI. 

This book is about the building blocks of data systems and the engineering it requires to provide the three pillars of *Reliability*, *Scalability*, and *Maintainability*.

Journey through a sometimes pessimistic geography :-

Ocean of Distributed data

Sea of Derived Data

Gulf of Binary Encodings

Bay of Causality

Partitioning Atoll

Wrecks of Homegrown consensus Alogorithms

Harsh Winds of Reality
